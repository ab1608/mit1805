# Studio 1 Questions

# 1. Put your code answering the R questions in this file.
# 2. Read all instructions carefully!
# 3. If code is given with a question it is meant to be used. Don't just ignore it.

# 4. Before uploading the the code: clear your environment and source
#    the entire file (choose source from the code menu).
#   -- Make sure that it runs without error and outputs just the
#     answers asked for in the questions.
#   -- Remember to use print statements to print the values asked for
# 5. **** Upload your code to  ****

# Problem 1. Tutorial
# Use lines 1-132 of studio1.r as a tutorial to learn a little more about R

#--------------------------------------
# Problem 2. Suppose there are n people in a room. We want to know the probability that at least one pair of them shares a birthday.

# Write a simulation of this and use it to estimate the first value of n for which the probability that (at least) two people share a birthday is greater than 0.5

#--------------------------------------
# Problem 3. If you have time use lines 133-end in studio1.r to learn how to make a plot of the probability of a shared birthday as a function of n.
